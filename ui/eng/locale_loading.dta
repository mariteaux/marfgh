; GH2 main tips
(loading_tip1 "The white tips of notes indicate a hammer-on or a pull-off. We've made these easier to spot - save yourself some trouble and don't strum unless you have to!")
(loading_tip2 "You'll get a multiplier when you play 10, 20, 30, and 40 notes in a row perfectly. Keep the streak going!")
(loading_tip3 "If you're great, Star Power can get you some nice scores. If you suck, Star Power can keep the crowd on your side. Either way, save it for when the time's right.")
(loading_tip4 "You can keep holding down the fret button if there's a stream of notes on that fret coming up.")
(loading_tip5 "Flatscreens and emulators tend to have lag that make it hard to hit the notes. Try \qCalibrate Lag\q under Video Settings on the Options menu if this is happening to you.")
(loading_tip6 "Practice Mode lets you slow the song, or individual sections, to a crawl so you can get your technique perfect. Practice makes perfect.")
(loading_tip7 "If you manage to hit all the notes in a song without any extra strums, you'll have \qFC'd\q, or gotten a \qfull combo\q on the song. You'll get a nice special message on the results screen for doing so.")

; Difficulty tips
(difficulty_tip1 "Aim for the highest difficulty you can play on. If that's only Easy, don't worry about it! We're just happy you're humoring us.")
(difficulty_tip2 "Higher difficulties mean more frets to worry about. Easy only has three, Medium has four, and Hard and Expert use all five.")
(difficulty_tip3 "It's all about the details. The higher the difficulty, the more the notes will look like what you hear.")
(difficulty_tip4 "Only Expert players have to worry about three note chords. Easy players don't have to worry about chords at all!")
(difficulty_tip5 "The fretboard will scroll much slower on Easy and Medium, so you have more time to see each note.")

(advanced_tip3 "Learn to \qalt-strum\q - strumming up and down alternatively can ease the wear and tear on your arm when the riffs get fast.")
(advanced_tip4 "Try the debug executable if you're so inclined - it adds a ton of fun and useful diagnostic tools and cheats for testing your mods and getting around the game quickly.")
(advanced_tip5 "If you hit a note at the last possible moment after activating Star Power, you'll \qsqueeze\q it into your Star Power combo and gain extra points for it.")
(advanced_tip6 "Focus Mode, available in the Modifiers menu, replaces the stage with a black void, which can speed up the game and improve performance if you need a boost.")
(advanced_tip7 "Each song has a \qpath\q of Star Power activations - when's most ideal to activate and when you should save up. Learning and using one is the key to top-tier scores.")
(advanced_tip8 "If you're clutch enough, during fast solos, strum with your elbow and use both hands for the frets.")
(advanced_tip9 "Hand stretches are essential! Guitar playing is fiddly stuff. Avoid the cramps and take breaks.")

; Multiplayer tips
(multi_coop_tip1 "You'll need to tilt TOGETHER to engage Star Power. We'll let the slower of you know when it's time to lift that guitar up.")
(multi_coop_tip2 "Your streaks are combined in Cooperative. If one of you misses, you both lose your multiplier, as well as your FC indicator.")
(multi_coop_tip3 "You both share the same pool of Star Power in Cooperative. Whichever of you has the easier part should make sure to hit those Star Power phrases to help the other through the tough bits.")
